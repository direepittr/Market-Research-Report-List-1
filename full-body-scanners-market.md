<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Full Body Scanners Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>X-ray Scanner</li><li>Millimeter Wave Scanner</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Full body scanners primarily fall into two market types: X-ray scanners and millimeter wave scanners. X-ray scanners utilize low-dose radiation to create detailed images of concealed objects within clothing, offering high-resolution detection capabilities. In contrast, millimeter wave scanners use non-ionizing radio frequency waves to generate body images, effectively identifying threats without exposing individuals to radiation. Both technologies are employed in airports and secure facilities to enhance security while balancing accuracy and passenger privacy concerns.</p></p>
