<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aviation Biofuel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fischer-Tropsch</li><li>Hydrogenated Vegetable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The aviation biofuel market primarily consists of two types: Fischer-Tropsch and Hydrogenated Vegetable Oils (HVO). Fischer-Tropsch biofuels are derived from converting biomass into synthetic liquid fuels through gasification and subsequent chemical processes, producing high-quality kerosene-like fuels. In contrast, HVO is produced by hydrotreating vegetable oils or animal fats, resulting in a renewable diesel that can be directly used in jet engines. Both types enhance sustainability in aviation by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and dependency on fossil fuels.</p></p>
