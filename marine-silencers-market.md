<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Marine Silencers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Resistive</li><li>Reactive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Marine silencers are crucial for reducing noise in marine engines and equipment, categorized into two main types: resistive and reactive. Resistive silencers absorb sound waves using porous materials, allowing them to dissipate energy and minimize noise levels primarily through friction. In contrast, reactive silencers utilize chambers and baffles to create sound wave interference, effectively canceling out specific frequencies. Both types play significant roles in enhancing comfort on vessels while ensuring compliance with marine noise regulations.</p></p>
